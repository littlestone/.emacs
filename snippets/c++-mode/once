# This snippet inserts #define guards.
#
# If your header file is nested in a /src/ or /include/ directory, the guard
# will be named to reflect the location of your header in relation to that
# directory. For example, if your file is "proj/include/proj/util/foo.h" then
# the guard will be named "__PROJ_UTIL_FOO_H_INCLUDED__".
